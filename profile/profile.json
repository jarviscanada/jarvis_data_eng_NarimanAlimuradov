NLTK and natural language processing heuristics are used to evaluate the video title, and Keras image recognition models are used to evaluate the thumbnail. Training data was web-scraped and fetched using the YouTube API. Deployed using Flask at https://thumbnail.nalimuradov.com.",

  "summary": "Hi I'm Nariman, a graduate from McMaster University's software engineering program and I have recently joined Jarvis as a data engineer! During my undergrad, I spent eight months as a software developer for Adlib Software, where I designed document detection models on the machine learning team. I enjoy spending my free time volunteering. While at McMaster, I spent a year teaching workshop classes to students at elementary schools across Hamilton, and during the past six months, I have been volunteering as a crisis responder for the Kids Help Phone text line. I love programming and computer science because it is a language that can be applied to every facet of life. Software provides immeasurable benefits to everything in our lives and I think it's important to have a deep understanding of it."
