      "description": "Built and cloud-hosted a Python recommendation model that uses the Reddit API to suggest new subreddits (online communities) to the user based on the subreddits they like. Reddit user activity is periodically aggregated to optimize and update the recommendations over time. Deployed using Flask and Heroku. Try it out at https://subreddits.nalimuradov.com.",

      "description": "Developed a Python machine learning application that estimates the viewership success of a YouTube video by analyzing the video title and thumbnail. NLTK and natural language processing heuristics are used to evaluate the video title, and Keras image recognition models are used to evaluate the thumbnail. Training data was web-scraped and fetched using the YouTube API. Deployed using Flask at https://thumbnail.nalimuradov.com.",

      "description": "Developed a Linux monitoring agent that allows a user to monitor and store machine specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. The agent employs Bash Scripts to collect machine hardware information, which is then stored in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Resource usage is fetched periodically with Crontab, and the aggregated data can then be manipulated using SQL queries.",

The application allows for the posting of new Tweets, fetching already created Tweets, as well as deleting Tweets. Made in Java with the user of the Twitter REST API. Implemented with a DAO design pattern and structured using Maven and Springboot. Packaged with Docker.",

During my undergrad, I spent eight months as a software developer for Adlib Software, where I designed document detection models on the machine learning team. I enjoy spending my free time volunteering. While at McMaster, I spent a year teaching workshop classes to students at elementary schools across Hamilton. I have also been volunteering over the past six months as a crisis responder for the Kids Help Phone text line. I love programming and computer science because it is a language that can be applied to every facet of life. Software provides immeasurable benefits to everything in our lives, and it's critical to have a deep understanding of it."
