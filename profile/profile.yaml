# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. 80 words
summary: Hi I'm Nariman, a graduate from McMaster University's software engineering program and I have recently joined Jarvis as a data engineer! During my undergrad, 
I spent eight months as a software developer for Adlib Software, where I designed document detection models on the machine learning team. I enjoy spending my 
free time volunteering. While at McMaster, I spent a year teaching workshop classes to students at elementary schools across Hamilton, and during the past six months,
I have been volunteering as a crisis responder for the Kids Help Phone text line. I love programming and computer science because it is a language that can be applied to 
every facet of life. Software provides immeasurable benefits to everything in our lives and I think it's important to have a deep understanding of it.

    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NarimanAlimuradov/tree/master/linux_sql"
    description: "Developed a Linux monitoring agent that allows a user to monitor and store machine specifications and usage information for multiple Linux systems. 
    The agent employs Bash Scripts to collect machine hardware information, which is then stored in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. 
    Resource usage is fetched periodically with Crontab and the data aggregated can then be manipulated using SQL queries."

  - name: "Subreddit Recommender"
    git_url: "https://github.com/nalimuradov/subreddit_recommender"
    description: "Built and cloud-hosted a Python recommendation model that uses the Reddit API to suggest new subreddits (online communities) to the user based on the 
    subreddits they like. Reddit user activity is periodically aggregated to optimize and update the recommendations over time. Deployed using Flask and Heroku. 
    Try it out at https://subreddits.nalimuradov.com."
    
  - name: "YouTube Thumbnail Evaluator"
    git_url: "https://github.com/nalimuradov/thumbnail_evaluator"
    description: "Developed a Python machine learning application that estimates the viewership success of a YouTube video by analyzing the video title and thumbnail.
    NLTK and natural language processing heuristics are used to evaluate the video title, and Keras image recognition models are used to evaluate the thumbnail.
    Training data was web-scraped and fetched using the YouTube API. Deployed using Flask at https://thumbnail.nalimuradov.com."
    
  - name: "Pokemon Team Generator"
    git_url: "https://github.com/nalimuradov/pokemon_team"
    description: "Created a React web application that generates the user a team of six Pokemon based on their filters and criteria. 
    Designed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and deployed with the help of Heroku, Github, and Node.js. Available at https://pokemon.nalimuradov.com."
